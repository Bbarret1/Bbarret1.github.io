<p>Dear Reader,</p>
</div>

<div id="post_content">
<p>I want to write down my summer goals so that I have something to look back on to see what I was able to accomplish. I think writing down what you plan to do is very important because if you don't then in a week or two's time you will feel differently about the thoughts you originally had. If you ever write anything down and then look back on it you can see that even day to day we change immensily.</p> 

<p>First Goal: To Code.<br>I will be learning a lot more coding at work, and through that I want to take my newfound passion for coding to the next level. I want to work more on my website and put up some projects that I have been working on. Putting them in an appealing format is going to be tough for me but I am excited to show how much I have learned so quickly. Some of the projects I am doing at work will also translate into some demonstrations I can put up. I want to blog as well and write down my journey through coding. I really like the idea of being able to look back and see how this all started one day.</p> 

<p>Second Goal: Learn to play Ukelele.<br>I have tried several time to learn an instrument but everytime I give up. I wrefuse to give up on this one. Hopefully I can post some sound clips when I finally get something worth listening to. But I really enjoy music and have always enjoyed  playing instruments, I have just always lacked the time and commitment. This summer presents a perfect opportunity to start that.</p> 

<p>Third Goal: Take Pictures.<br>I really enjoy photography and now that I have a camera I want to really spend some quality time with it. Hopefully by the end of the summer I will have somethign to show for my efforts, and the beginnings of a portfolio.</p> 

<p>With these three goals I hope to improve myself and by doing so be even happier with the person I am and the person I am going to be.</p>
