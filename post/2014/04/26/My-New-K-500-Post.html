<p>Dear Reader,</p>
</div>

<div id="post_content">
<p>I recently bought a DSLR:</p> 

<img src="/images/blog_pictures/Camera.jpg"/>

<p>I really enjoy taking photos and I have always wanted to have one, so after doing some research I landed on the Pentax K-500. I have found that since I recieved it I am even more pleased than I thought I would have been. The K-500 was quite affordable, and it shoots amazing pictures. I found it on Amazon for around $370 and ended up getting an additional $50 for the camera having already been opened, although not used. I was extrmeely pleased as this camera was originally $600 and is currently priced around $450. </p>

<p>The quality of this camera simply blew me away. If you right click any of the pictures and "open them in a new tab" you will be able to see just how big they are, and how much quality they have. These are some birds in mid flight that I managed to capture. The previous image is a cardinal and the following three are a woodpecker that I was trying to get close to and it flew off.</p>

<p>If you look closely at the pictures of the woodpecker you will notice that th ebackground is actually blurry. I was tracking the woodpecker while it flew which meant that I was spinnning the camera and the background images are blurry. But even through that it managed to keep the bird perfectly clear. </p>

<p>If you are curious about more images I have taken look around my site and any image you see was taken by me with the K-500. Here are a few more images I have taken with it.</p>

<p>I couldn't be more pleased with this camera, and the pictures it produces. If you are looking for a camera that creates great quality images I would suggest you take a look at the Pentax K-500.</p>
